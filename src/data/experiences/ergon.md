The stack I mainly use: **jQuery**, **.NET**, **PHP**, **VB6**

### âœ¨ Most Significant Projects

- Mantainance and development of the company's ERP software
- Implementation of new features on the 3 main web applications: B2B e-commerce, CRM, and sales management
- Optimization of a VB6 application to update web data from the ERP

### ðŸ’ª Problems and Challenges

- Learning about the architecture of the ERP and web applications (which were developed in the 90s)
- Maintaining a VB6 application required several customizations to resolve obsolete APIs
- Adding a custom feature flag system to the main web application to enable/disable features for specific customers
- Improving the performance of the module that sends data from the ERP to the web (the process involved compressing packages and sending them via FTP to the web server)

### ðŸ§  Responsibilities and Skills Acquired

I took on responsibilities such as managing individual clients, defining estimates for them, and providing bug support. I learned how to approach problems despite the limitations of the old codebase. Special thanks to Alessandro, who taught and guided me: I learned to value the underlying aspects of things, starting from a low level. This allowed me to deepen my knowledge of **vanilla JS**, **CSS**, and **HTML**.
