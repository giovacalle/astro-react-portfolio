The stack I mainly use: **React**, **Next.js** (**TypeScript**)

### âœ¨ Most Significant Projects

- Implementation of new content management using headless CMS (Sanity.io)
- Migration to monorepo
- Internal hackathon for the creation of a new product: an audio player that allowed listening to the sounds of pollinators [blog](https://blog.3bee.com/voices-from-the-oases-3bees-playlist-for-biodiversity/)
- Support in the implementation of a new design system (primitive ui)
- Creation of custom charts for the B2B dashboard
- Support for the UI team and development of a new B2B section ([regeneration](https://www.3bee.com/owner/foxy-love-the-bee-1/regeneration/site/26/))
- Blog rewrite: refactor legacy code, new design, and content management ([blog](https://blog.3bee.com/))

### ðŸ’ª Problems and Challenges

- Blog performance optimization: reducing build times, improving SEO
- Coordination of an external agency for new design and copywriting
- Removal of legacy code (adaptation to monorepo)
- Interaction with maps and geospatial data (adapting a vanilla js library to React)

### ðŸ§  Responsibilities and Skills Acquired

Over time, I gained greater autonomy and responsibility, particularly with the blog rewrite project.<br/>
I took almost total ownership of the project, leading to a significant improvement in static content generation, which resulted in increased organic traffic.<br/><br/>
In addition to enhancing my technical knowledge with React and Next.js (especially in terms of performance, e.g. SSR and ISR), I acquired important skills in SEO optimization, **critical thinking**, and communication/coordination with other teams.
